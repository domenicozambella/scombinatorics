# Scombinatorics

These are some aberrant notes on combinatorics.

>   We approach bipartite graphs (in particular, set systems) with model theory in the back of our mind.
>
>   Notation is borrowed from logic (without any clear purpose) and is used consistently throughout the notes - even when it obscures theorems and bloats proofs.

They may be aberrant also for other reasons that I am not aware of.

Finally, the title is a pun intended for Italian speakers.
